This is an analysis conducted as part of intriduction to the pandas library.
---------------------------------------------------
The following steps were involved in performing this analysis.
Step 1: Create a DataFrame from the list of dictionaries below:[{'product_id':23, 'name':'computer', 'wholesale_price': 500, 'retail_price':1000, 'sales':100}, {'product_id':96, 'name':'Python Workout', 'wholesale_price': 35,'retail_price':75, 'sales':1000}, {'product_id':97, 'name':'Pandas Workout', 'wholesale_price': 35, 'retail_price':75, 'sales':500}, {'product_id':15, 'name':'banana', 'wholesale_price': 0.5,'retail_price':1, 'sales':200}, {'product_id':87, 'name':'sandwich', 'wholesale_price': 3,'retail_price':5, 'sales':300}]
----------------------------------------------
Step 2: Calculate the Total Profit for each product using the formula
net_revenue_per_product = (retail_price - wholesale price) * sales
------------------
Step 3: Determine the following
How much total net revenue you received from all of these sales?
What product is product retail price more than twice the wholesale price?
How much did the store make from food vs. computers vs. books?
Because your store is doing so well, youâ€™re able to negotiate a 30% discount on the wholesale price of goods. Calculate the new net revenue
